  - description: Sequence Diagram for Negotiation
    explanation: '<b>For negotiation</b>: A seller can send a catalog and allow negotiation for a particular item over price, quanity and commodity specification. All the terms that are negotiable among these three must be specified in the "NEGOTIATION_SPECIFICATION" tag group, with the path of the attribute mentioned in the "code". "NEGOTIATION_SPECIFICATION" must only be sent when the seller wants to allow negotiation over the item attributes/price/quantity.'

  - description: Selection and Negotiation
    explanation: '<b>For negotiation (as a Buyer)</b>: A buyer can change the value of the attributes whose path was passed by the seller in the "NEGOTIATION_SPECIFICATION" tag group in a new tag group "NEGOTIATION_BAP". This tag group can only contain codes that were previously passed in "NEGOTIATION_SPECIFICATION".<br><b>For negotiation (as a Seller)</b>: The seller can reject the offer by sending error code in /on_select or counter-negotiate or accept the offer. For counter-negotiation, seller needs to add the same attribute code path in the "NEGOTIATION_BPP" tag group. The values of the code must differ from values proposed by buyer in "NEGOTIATION_BAP". For accepting an offer, a seller will send the same exact values as buyer in the "NEGOTIATON_BPP" tag group and if both of these tag groups are matched, the negotiation can be termed as success. A final quote should be shared by the seller in the same /on_select.'
